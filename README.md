👋 Hi there! I'm Garima Gautam
I'm a passionate self-taught developer from India, currently transitioning into the tech world after completing my MCA and dedicating several years to full-time motherhood.

💻 I’m building a career in frontend web development, with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and how technology can positively impact the environment.

🌱 I recently built my personal portfolio website and I'm actively learning through real projects, one step at a time.

🔁 I'm focused on:

Writing clean, responsive HTML/CSS/JS code

Building projects that solve real-world problems

Growing every single day with consistency and purpose

🌍 My dream is to become a software engineer, work remotely, support my family, and someday run a company that creates meaningful tech solutions — especially ones that help nature heal 💚

📫 Feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect and grow together!
